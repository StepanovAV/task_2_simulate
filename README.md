task â„–2 with simulating epidemic algorithm, please before using read DOCUMENTATION.pdf

    how to run simulate.py from console:
    20 - number of nodes
    1000 - number of packets
    with_queue, with_choice - my algorithms

    C:\Users\..\Folder>python simulate.py 20 10000
    In 79.98% cases all nodes received the packet
    total: 148640 iterations
    time: 2.363694190979004

    C:\Users\..\Folder>python simulate.py 20 10000 with_queue
    In 88.65% cases all nodes received the packet
    total: 138343 iterations
    time: 2.3137128353118896

    C:\Users\..\Folder>python simulate.py 20 10000 with_choice
    In 100.00% cases all nodes received the packet
    total: 90000 iterations
    time: 0.5724201202392578
